Transnational Stages is a collaboration between MIT, the Univeristy of Bergen in Bergen, Norway, and several other institutions to create set of data visualization tools meant to help historians analyze the theater productions in the 17th and 18th century Atlantic world.

## [Star Battle](https://github.com/akessah/star_battle)

Star Battle is a logic game in which the player tries to add stars to cells in a given grid such that there are two stars in every row, column, and shaded region. My role in this group project was to implement the actual puzzle logic and handle interactions between the web api and the server that holds puzzle instances.
